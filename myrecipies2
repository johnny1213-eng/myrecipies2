Raspberry juice will give a beautiful soft pink color with no food coloring.
*If you see little clumps of butter after you mix the wet ingredients don’t panic, it all works out by the time you mix in the dry ingredients. *You can even use melted butter and warm the milk and sour cream up a bit if you like.
*You can substitute whole milk yogurt for the sour cream if desired, I do it all the time and can’t really tell the difference.
*To get FLAT layers that are moist inside and out try using cake strips! You can buy a set online, or make your own from foil and paper towels at home. I made a whole blog post on it so check it out if you’re interested!
*If you like a less sweet frosting try my Italian or Swiss meringue buttercream recipes! They’re Creamy, dreamy and oh so delicious.
